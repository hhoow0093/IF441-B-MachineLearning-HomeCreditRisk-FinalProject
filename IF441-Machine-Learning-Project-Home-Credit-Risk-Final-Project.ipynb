The dataset can be accessed by using this <a href = https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dwiwahyuef/home-credit-indonesia-default-risk>Link</a>. The main reason why we use this dataset because we could not find any trusted journal from scimagjor that discuss about this topic. Therefore, we could use this opportunity to further analyze what is going on.\n","\n","Note : Before we start to perform data manipulation to create models. we also research some journal that is very similar to credit risk analysis but not as specific as this topic. We read those journals to find some **references** and potential **research gap** for us to implement in this journal. You can access the file we used to read all the journals <a href = \"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UUFPzZtpT_SAIC7mc16DE4hJyCBK8i_aWLWxOL_yRX4/edit?usp=sharing\n","\">here.</a>.\n","\n","\n","## Group members\n","\n","1.
